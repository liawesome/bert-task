Honoring our parents is a trandition of Chinese. In my daily life. I always help my parents go chores when they are tired, I make a big meal for them to let them happy. 
In my opin ion, honoring parents is really necessary for us. Because parents give a birth to us, and they try their best to look after us. They can do everything for us. The one who can honor parents, he can also respect others. So it‘s time toexpress our love to them. 
As a student, we have many ways to honor our parents. For example, when they are sad, we can give them a hug and share the happy things with them. We are supposed to be patient with them when they talk with us. 
Honoring comes first. let's take action to honor our parents!"

As a student, we can throw the litter into the bins and not use the wooden chopstiwks. Also, when we go shopping, we can a bag. If everyone does this, I believe we can set wo a beautiful earth where the skies are blue, the land is green and the water are clear. "
a (95).jpg,15,"Solve Environmental problems
A good environment is good for our health. But now our environment has become worse and worse. So how can we solve environmental problems? Let me give you some suggestions. 
When we walk along the street, if we see litter on the rood, we should pick it up and throw it into the bins. We must make sure the litte fall into the bins, instead of beside the bins. We should take civilized actions. And the air pullotion is serious. We are supposed to drive a car twice a week if we really need it. Other time we can ride a bike or take the bus. The advantages of riding a bike is both good for health and environment. We also should protect animals. Don't hurt them Because they are our good friends. 
So together, our actions can make a difference and lead to a better future. Everyone in the earth should play a part in solving these problems. "

One day a man and a woman pass by the bin. He threw the litters on the road instead the bin. The woman was eating something and then threw the the road. So more and more people threw the litters on the road. The enviornment was gradually been bad. But nobody cleans it up. When we saw the same thing we need to do something to protect the environment. such as tell them the importance of the environment or let them pick the litters up. We need to throw the litters in the bin. Wen we go to work we can ride a bike instead of driving. It's good for our health and our enviornment and it doesn't cost anything. When we saw litters on the road we should picked them up. 
I helieve that lour actions can make a differnce of our world. Do you have anything special ideas? Can you tell me?"
a (97).jpg,17,"Today is Sunday. I saw a man and woman were littering rubbish outside the bin rather than into the been. And the environment around the bin is so dirty that I don't want to come there. I think if we see that, we should prevent them from throwing the rubbish everywhere. Because the earth is the beautiful home to belongs to humans. So we should keep the public place clean and tidy. 
These days, the pollution gets more and more seriously. To cut down the environment pollution, we can do something small in our everyday lives, such as take the bus or ride a bike instead of driving. The air will be fresh. And plant more trees, make our streets and neighborhoods more beautiful. 
Now the environment is getting worse day by day, but if we take actions to save the earth, I believe that our actions will make difference to save the beautiful world. "

Now, more and more people are not civilized. For example there is a man who has seen a bin. But he still doesn't throw rubbish into the bin. And a woman near him is walking and eating. So the food rubbish fail down. Then I should prevent people throwing rubbish and ask them litter into bin. Because It pollute envirment and pollute our only home, earth. But no matter where there is bad people. So we all show up to prevent them. The government also need to make laws to How to protice environment. If people don't listen to it.

To solve these problems and keep the public places beautiful and clean. I think government should develop laws to protect the environment. The most important is that we should do it from ourselves, from small things beside you. When we see rubbish on the earth, we pick them up. And we should be civilized.

Besides, if people want to eat some takefood, they are not e pected to use woaden chopsticks and forks. On the one hand it's good for people healthy, on the other hand, it can make the wironment greatly. Finally, if people go shopping, they will bring abag instead of shophay. Also, we are supposed to take the bus or ride the bike instead of driving. 
All in all, if people know the importance of environmental protection and take adion about the envronnent. I believe our world will very clean and reauty. "

b (155).jpg,18,"Nowadays, many children are treated as little emperorsat hame. This means their parents give them love by mistake. So I feel like giving some advice for both parents and childre. 
First, I think the parents should believe in their children and they don't need to do everything. Then, if their children can't do that, parents can give some suggestions to them so that they can make their own decisions. For children, they are not supposed to depend on their parents to much, they are expected to learn to do housework and take care of thewselves. Besides, they must face problems in person and go out of their way to solve their own troubles This can help them become excellent quickly. The more troubles they solve, the better future they will have. 
we all know that these parents want to give their kids the best, but please learn to teach your kid correctly. This can help them. "

I thank exercise a very morningul thing to do . We ask some poople about their exercise we found that only thirty two percent of them do execise more than one hour and sixty eight percent of them do exercise less than one hour eveng day but why do so many people have less exercise time There are reasons some people said that they were not good at doing exercise or they wre not interested in exercise And others said that they had too much homewok that they were not available. 
But I thimk exercise is very important in our life It can make us healthier happier more confident and oure minds sharper . we are staying at home, we can jump and do sit ups After the virus is killed, we can run every morning and we can play basketball, play seccer and so on 
Exercase can improve our resistance and it can make us we will have a better life.

They are the top of food chain, but them number of them have dropped by 90 . Now many wild animals organize asked the government to make laws to protect animals.

Many wild animal are in great danger. For example, panda is symbol of China, but the number of them is less than one thousand. Why Because people cut down forest. The lose their homes and they can't find enough food to eat, so they have fewer babies. And humans some activities have already coused many problems. If wild animals number drop too low, it will make a big difference ecosystem and it will bring danger to all life in the world. So humans are hurting themselves We must stop doing something that hurt animals. After all, the Novel coronavirus pnumonia has infectious, and it has already infectious to people. It kills many life. To protect animals, we should don't eat animals. And don't buy something is made of animals. And we can develop plenty of laws to prevent some bad persons to hurt even till animals.

Why protect them Because they are in great danger There have two reasons. First, people kill animals for money, just like elephants. Second, people take away their land, they don't have enough food and place to live. The result is that ecosystem will be broken so that the number of wild animals will be less and less. In order to protect them we must realize that the important of animals first. Don't cut down trees to give animals the best house. Don't eat them Don't let them in a great danger

There are many new novel coronavirus pnuemonia patient in WuHan. They all lay in bed waiting for the doctors. As so far. The environment of animals the whole ecosystem will be destroyed and dangerous. 
Animals will become more and more unleratle. Killing animals will have a great impact on us. For example without animals, they will continue to grow and flad our homes. 
We have to protect our environment. I have many suggestions. Such as, if we are friendly to animals as we are to our friends. We will together which is also a good way. We are not allowed to dist animals lives and we are not allowed to kill animals, and we are not allowed to eat. We must not destroy our infectious. We should protect the animals in our country set a good example for all around us. "

The question is about Novel coronavirus pneumonia. People always cut down the trees and buildings and we often wat the animals. The ecosystem is broken by people. 
So many animals can't go home, because their home are broken by people. And many animals are dead, people kill them to make clothes or eat them. A lot of animals will dead, it has a little reason because of the environment, but the most reason is because that people kill them and not stop. 
Now, the nature is angry, we paid the price. We killed the animals and eat them, the ecosystem will be unbalanced. Humans will be implicated. 
So, let's save the animals together, to protect them is to protect ourselves. We should stop killing animals, let's do it together. "

Now many wild animals are also infected. Many wild animals are dead, too. The result of killing wild animals, we are also infected. Because the ecosystem is hurt. We have a lot of people who have new coronavirus. 
I have a lot of advice, let me tell you about how to protect ourselves. First, we should refused to eat wild animals. Because some animals have virus, we can't eat them. Second, we should wash our hands, when we go home, we should wash our hands first. Third, when we go out, we must wear masks, or our bacteria will be transmitted others. Similarly, we should pay attention to don't eat out. Futher, we hold opinion that as long as you persist, you will succeed. 
As this particular time, we should go out as little as possible. If we got out, we must weir protecture masks to prevent our selves from getting infected. In addition, we should keep good healihy habies and keep our body clean. "

First of all, don't use wild annals to cook meals. Secondly try not to touch wild animals. Finally take good care of the environment and protect the hoom of wild annals.

So they won't killed these animals and protest them. Killed animals will break the ecosystem. But, although people not killed this animals, none knows, people if don't kill in the future.

I suggest that there is no doubt that killing them has a bad effect. The viruses like SARS and NCP are conected to wild. Although more people stop to kill animals. But more people continue to kill them. This way is not good for environmention. We can stop their ways together. So we are good for environment and animals. That we should keep on stopping.

Here are my suggestions. First of all, the government need to develop laws to protect them. If people kill them they will be punished. Secondly, we can't buy clothes made of fur. We are suppose to plant more trees to give them a comfortable environment. Finally, we should realize that animals are our friends. we are supposed to love them. Let's take action now "

People may never think these will bring difficulties to ourselves, such as Novel coronavirus pneumonia. It is a certain fact that wild animals take kinds of viruses with infectious. We not only have ideas to protect ourselves easier, but also they are harmful to the ecosystem. As the saying goes ""Animals are humans' friend"". So I suggest that we are supposed to protect wild animals and keep away from the animals which have all kinds of viruses. 
Only in this way, can we have friendly relation ship between humans and animals. If we get on with animals, the home and even world will be better "

The reason why can't go out is because people are killing wild animals. So we should protect wild animals and get along with them harmoniously, We should take the initictive to protect animals from eating wild animal and killing wild animals. Only is this way can we quickly overcome this epidemic and win the epidemic. 
To protect animals is to protect ourselves and let use live in harmony with animals. "

In some areas, people like eating wild animals, so they have this infectious virus. The wild animal is get fewer and fewer around the wirld because of the kill. People kill them because they can be sell at a very high price. Most of the wild animals are in great dangers. The ecosystem can't be able to be control of our hands as the wild animals' numbers dropped. Some areas are appear infectious illness because of this. 
what can we do about this We can refused to buy everything that is made of wild animals. And protect wild animals when we see them outside. For this time. We should stay at home. But when we have to go out, we must wear masks. The first step is washing your hands as you go back home. Besides, if someone in front of you and you want to caught, you need to cover your nose and mouth use your arms.

Also, you will have the Novel coronavitus even other virus. It can make us feel bad so please stop eating wild animals. The Navel caronavirus pneummin has infactious. So to protect ourselves. we should stay at home. In our daily life, we are expected to was our hands carefully. And we shouldn't eat wild animals.

e (123).jpg,16,"We all know there was the Novel corona virus pneumonia that appeared in Wuhan in winter. But do you realize that it was separated from wild animals to people If we protect animals, maybe it don't happen. 
Wild animals are in a great danger. People catch them to eat or make them into clothes so that most of wild animals are endangerous. And if we kill animals too many, the ecosystem will be broken . The environment will be worse and worse. In the future, our home will be broken by ourselves. 
So we are supposed to understand the importance of saving wild animals. And government is expected to prevent from killing the animals. School needs to take classes about how to protect the animals.

First, we should realize the importance of protecting animals. Animals are our friends, so we should take core of them. Give them a wonderful home. So we should not cut down trees. Then, we should not buy fur clother People should stop killing animals. And we should refuse wild animals. Finally we should regard animals as our families. The earth is our common home. If animals are missing on earth. the earth will disappear. So protecting animals is like to protect ourselves. 
We are not alone in the world. We can not live without plants and animals around us so protecting them is very important. And we must stop people from killing animals. If each of us can plant a tree and build a animals house the world will be more beautiful.

Hunting of wild animals will not only endanger the wild animals. but also endanger human beings themselves. So we should protect them instead of killing them. In my opinion, start with caring for the environment Give them back thier beautiful homeland. No killing wild animals. Call for more people to make an effort to protect wild animals.

g (1).jpg,18,"For the last three years, we have had many useful lessons. Many students may have their most unforgettable lesson, however. as for me, the most special lesson is the first class which we have online. 
Because of the illness, we couldn't go to school when the winter holiday was over. The best way to solve the problem was studing online. Through the comeputers. we could see each of classmates' faces and hear the voice of our teaches. Luckily, everyonewas healthy and I come to realize that how much I missed them and loved them. In that lesson, all of the studens worked hard including me, because I knew the importance of Live and friendship. We should live and live well in love. 
To be honest, the lesson itselfwas very common. But it showed that nothing can stop from love. so I will remember "
g (2).jpg,15,"Nowadays, more and more lessons in our dialy life. But always have a special or an improuounce lesson influence ourselves. 
In my opinion. It's an Engliss lesson. Our English teacher took a bag and played a game with us called""I can make sentences""Our teacher told our rules and asked us to follow the rules. When the game start, we all raised our hands. and shouting aloud when the teacher called me. I was so nervous that I couldn't say a complete sentence. After class. I found because of my poor pronounce and badly grammar. So I failed. About this I found the grammar and pronounce was very imprant and if we want to study hard we must learn these better. and keep fighting. 
All in all, this special let me learn lot and know how to study and how to improve myself. "
g (3).jpg,16,"The classes is students learning life's important place. In the past three years, there have been so many things that we can't forget in the lessons. And we learn a lot by the lessons, so that, we can make our dreams come true. We also have some important memories that we can never forget them. 
One day, my English teacher walked into our classroon with a paper bag. She told us that there are something in her bag, if we can guess what in English, she will give it to us. Then we had a great time with happiness and warmth. 
I learned that study also can be interesting. We can learn so quickly with happiness. Although it have to spend more time than normal lessons, it really interesting that most of the students will not feel sleepy "
g (4).jpg,16,"We have studied since nine years ago. Mostly we study In our classroom and happen a lot of things in here. For example, interesting thing makes your classmates laugh. And exciting things make you wake up, even if sad thingsma ke you want to criy. you must remember the most important class for you and so do I. Let me tell you. 
Last year, in our English class, our English teacher was very sad and She felt we let her down. Because we don't finished our English homework and she so believed us. In class nobody said anything, only though of and though of anagin. Then our English teacher let us look up her face and told us how she loved us and how she wanted us go to a great junior high school. After class, we all finished our homework and thought back ourselves. But one day ago. We liked English more than before. 
I know parents and teacher, only they want you become better. "
g (5).jpg,16,"These years. We have many different lessons. We can learn so much in this special lesson. We also have many good feelings. 
When I was Grade 8. I remember we have a special Chinese lesson. This lesson was third class on Thursday I remember our chinese teacher found a lot of poems of ancient China She showed us some poems as everyone knows I felt these poems very and lovely. so after this class I and my friends were falling in love with this poems One year later. I have a reading habit Before I am sleeping. I will read a poem I think this poem can help my sleeping and make me relaxed. 
All in all in this class I learned a lot I think a special lesson can make us more interested in this subject. "
g (6).jpg,17,"once upon a time. I didn't like my English class. Every class was like a bad dream for me. Because the teacher spoke so quickly and boring that I didn't understand her untill that a special lesson. 
For me, a special lesson is full of alive and changing ourselves learning knowledge in joy. That day, my English teacher changed the difficult words into songs to make us better remember. And the teacher communicated with us in English to improve my pronunciation. At first, I didn't understand what they were talking. But with the help of my English teacher. I had a lot of knowledge. 
Now, I really like my English class. "
g (7).jpg,15,"Everyone should have a special lesson. And we should have important memories in a special lesson. We should learn a lot in a special lesson. 
last year, I didn't like English. Everyclass is like a bid dream for me. I just hid behind my textbook and never said anything But in that special lesson, I fell in love with English. The teacher asked us to play a game. And we should prepare some English cards. Then, the teacher asked us to take a card. And everyone takes their am cards to make students guss. But, I didn't like this game. I was afraid. The teacher told me, you should overcone yourself. And we should never give up. So, I did this game, and I was not afraid. 
All in all, the special lesson taught me that we should never give up if we don't try. That lesson. I had a good time. "
g (8).jpg,17,"I had a special lesson two years ago. And it is one of the most special lesson that I have ever had. 
On this day, our chinese teacher told us that we can leave our classroom to admire the sp ring. Because the spring was coming. We were so surprised. The sun was warm, It was good with the nice grass, the lovely bird, the colurful flowers. I felt relaxed. In the end. We were happy to leave. Our Chinese teacher told us when we felt busy. What's the best way to walk into nature. Happy time was always short. The class was over. But I will never forget this lesson. 
All in all, it is one of the most special lesson I have. "
g (9).jpg,17,"There are a lot of lessons in our lives, but it must be a lesson that everyone can't forget. The most special lesson is an English class for me. 
In the past, I was so afraid to ask questions because of my poor pronunication. So I used to hide behind my textbook and never say anything. But one day. I was asked in the English class first. I replied so slowly that I wanted to hide forever. But my teacher didn't be angry and she was patient with me to teach over and over again. Thanks to teacher's encourgments, I'd spirit to learn and say. 
I learned that we never know what we can do if we don't try. Only try will we have a chance to improve ourselves. It's so importent for me that I will remember it forever. "
g (10).jpg,16,"Looking back at these part three years. I remember many things. But in all kinds of lesson, I remember the special lesson. 
Last year we had an English class. I had a fever in t hat class. but I didn't ask for leave My members found something wrong with me and all came to care about me. I's not big deal. I replied. At first. I was able to keep. However I gradually wanted to sleep. I told the teacher about my situation. she was very worried about me and told me to get down and rest. After class. I woke up that I found there are lots of notebooks and textbooks on my table. They are taken notes of that class by my team members. There is also a cup of hot water. I am very touched by them. 
I found caring about others can bring great warmth to others. At the same time. you will receive the same happiness. I will never foget the special lesson. and those who helped me. "
g (11).jpg,14,"I have been a student for so many years. that there are many unforgettable memories Then, let me tell you something interesting. 
In the Chinese class, we are divided seven groups to study. Each group sends a person to answer qnestions. I remember that we spent 40 minutes just to discuss the answer to one question. But in the end, all of us is wrong. Even so, we still felt very happy. Whenever we talk about it, we all laugh. Because we thought we were a little stupid at that time. It's a funny things. In this class, we learned that the reswlts are important, but the process is also very important. 
Actully, I miss that lesson very much. It's a special lesson. "
g (12).jpg,9,"It's time for class. A special class is staring. Why is it special? 
Our first time on PE, we have large activites Run round and round the playgroud. Never stop. The PE teacher said it would exercise us. But there are some students who con't stand it like me. By the time I run the fifth round, I was time and and so sick . I feel very bad. The stndents are still running. My.  friends saw that I was uncomforable. They come running over. And they sent me go to the find teacher I felt sick on the way But they didn't hate me Maybe this is a friend. 
For me, my friends are as special as this class. "
g (13).jpg,13,"In winter holiday of 2019. we found Navel coronaurus pneumonia. In that time. we have a special lesson. 
Because the novel coronavirus pneamonia. So we can't study to school. we can only study at home. For three years. we only study at school. But now we have to study at home. As far as I know two month later. we will have a important exam So we must study hard at home. I first online class. I think it was interesting In class. My teacher opened our's sound and video it was liked study at school. 
This month's course. We study a lot of . This month's course is very special to us. Now We should study hard to prepare the exam. "
g (14).jpg,14,"There are many classes that I can't forget in my school life, especially one English class. 
In that class, our English teacher, Miss. Xie took us to the play ground. she told some students to run around the circle, some to play tennis and others to stand together. Then she taught us how to use ""be doing"" by watching some students's activities. My English wasn't good, but I learnt to use the sentence very quickly. In general, it was one of the most unfor table class that I have ever had. From then on, I know no matter what I learn, practice is very important. 
It is one of the most unfortable classes that I have ever had. That day, I was on the top of the world. "
g (15).jpg,15,"Everyone has the most unforgettable things. The thing that made me unforgettable happened last Christmas. 
We come to school that day. And I'm 15 minutes late. But the teacher didn't punish me. When I returned my seat. I was very surprised to find that there were a lots of snacks on my desk. I don't know who put it here for my desk. My nearly classmates told me that special people put them here for me. That even more full of doubts for me. Until the next moring reading. I asked my classmate again. He told me that the teacher gave them to us. They're Christmes present. Many stuents have already given gifes to the teacher after class. 
We give each other what we like things. This is full of wormth and love. Later I listened very carefully and regarded the teacher as my friend. "
g (16).jpg,15,"Nowadays, we have more and more lesons, but we seldom have the best one. In my opinion. A special lesson are supposed to be meanningful and lively. This can make students to study. . . . . .  
One day, our English teacher told us that we will have a special lesson about the wild animals. In that lesson. English teacher showed The many wild animals are endanger of dying out. The number of animals has dropped serious. We saw a movie together about a little dolphin who can't find her mother. We all cried whenwe saw it. It's very touching. The value animals are becoming less and less. The main reason is the development of society. 
Through this class, I know animals are our friends we must protect them and don't kill them. I believe that no buying no Killing. We should devevop laws to protect wild animals! This class is special to me! "
g (17).jpg,16,"Nowdays, we have more and more lesson, but we soldom have a good one. My favoite lesson is math class, because the math class is very interesting. 
There years ago, I was a little girl. And my favorite teacher is my math teacher. because she is very kind. One day my math teacher said ""let's piay a interesting game. ""We all said ""OK. ""Then we had a good time in this math class. We played many interesting games, and we had given a speech for our math teacher. Our math teacher was very happy the she gave our a big hug. Through this lesson, I learned to value the people around me. And value the time. Somethings will not come tack once they have passed. So we should value the people and value the time. 
I still remember the first time I saw your. This lesson is a special lesson for me. Because this lesson carries "
g (18).jpg,14,"I have learned a lot in the last three years. Also I have lots of funny lessons. Then I will tell you one of the moot interesting class 
It's time for us to have English class. Before we had English class. we must stand up to read English books loudly. And at the beginning of the class, we began to write words wnthout English books. Because I stayed up late to prepare for it last night, so I quickly wrote it Then we needed to learn new knowledge. The teacher spoke so quickly. that I can't understand it. Then I gave up listening it. Maybe the teacher found me, then she told us some funny stories. In the last class. the teacher always asked me questions. so that I can understand it. Before it. I can understand her all the time. And I'm interested in English. 
All in all. I know that we couldn't give up whenever we are. Try to do it and keep doing it. Then you will probably succeed. "
g (19).jpg,14,"We study in the one classroom. There are happend more things. Such as. happy, sad, exciting, moved. Today I want to say the moving class. 
one day. when the teacher came into the classroom. we was making noise. Teacher was very angry. And textbook was laid out on the table. And teacher told us. She must teaches our knowledge everyday. In the evening she needed to prepare for tomorow's class. she always have a conver sation with every one. we were very moved that day. Finally we said sorry to teacher. 
I leared say thanks in that class. And we know that teachers are good for us. Then I know we should learn very will. Teacher will happy. "
g (20).jpg,15,"On the one hand, classroom is a part of our study and life. On the other hand, it can bring knowledge and happiness. 
In a snowy weather, the students looked out of the window. All of a sudden teacher asked us to go to the plaground. It was snowing heavily. We stand on the playground for five minutes. If there are all kinds of problems, as long as we do our best we'll solve them. The teacher like our family to tell us how to do that. 
We have happy memorize with our teachers. We'll neven forget the teacher's love for us. "
g (21).jpg,10,"We have more and more lessons, but we seldom have a good one. A good lesson should be lively. 
In three years, it happend too much in class. such as, happy, sad, interesting. From the class. we have so many memorize to difficult forget. The lesson must made every student active and the teacher should be able to help more for their students to study Teacher give us a lot of questions. we should talk to with classmate to deal with these questions. Everyone can take his opinion. I think we can learned a lot from working with group. We can know work together is too important. And we can remember the knowledge clearly. 
When I have a good leson, I feel interesting and relaxed "
g (22).jpg,14,"Since I go to school, we were siting in the chair and looking at the black board. It seemed that the only way to receive the knowledge. 
But my chinese showed the other way to receive the knowledge. 
Last week, my chinese teachter asked us to write about protect the enviorment. When she asked us how much we knew about it. We didn't say anything. And shaked our heads.

At that time I felt like a huge drak cloud hovering over my head. Finally, after a long conversation I understood her and began to do housework. 
Since I am a mumber of this family, I should do housework. And no matter what, we should do it as soon as possible. "

I didn't understand why some parents make their kids help with housework. kids these days already have enough stress from school. We do not have to do housework. I though housework is a waste of time. I thought students should spend our time on study in order to get good grades and get into a good school. But my parents disagreed with me. They were always asking ""Could you get this for me? ""or ""Could you help me with that All of a sudden. My parents didn't do any housework and neither did I. I couldn't find a clean. dish.

My parents always wake early up me every day. Then I have to make my bed. But my parents take care of me and love me.

I think it is important for us to do housework and help with our parerts. It is not enough to just get good grades. Although we feel tired sometimes, we should develop our independence. If parents still do houswork by themselves without our help, they will feel so tired, too. so we should understand our parents.

And I must spend time on homework so that I could get into a good university. So there was no need for me to do it. But in my opinion, doing housework helps to develop children's independence and teaches how we look after themselves For example, our heighbors' daughter got into a good university but he had mo experience how to care of himself. His grades dropped. As a result, my parents think it's important for children to do housework. 
I hope there are more and more children learn how to look after themselves better. "

As far as I'm concerned, good health can promote our study. When faced with study pressure, a healthy body is especially essential as it keeps us in good condition and prevents us from illness. 
When we are at school, there are many ways to exercise our body and strengthen our physical health. For example, schools should add more P. E.  classes to our daily schedile, which allows us to take more exercise. Besides, after school, students should go to the playground or stadium to participate in sports instead of burying themselves In the classroom all day. Both health and academic performance are vital for a student. Never should me sacrifice our health only to attain good marks! "
high_b (65).jpg,20,"To takle with the widespread health problems of chinese students such as obesity, poor eyesight and stress, some suggest including P. E . in the Gaokao, which arouses heated discussion. 
From my perspective, I am not in favor of the idea of including P. E.  in the Gaokao. First and foremost, adding one more subject to the Gaokao will surely add to students' psychological stress. What's more, with the am of achieving high scores in the P. E.  test, students might throw themselves into a large amount of exercise, which will lead to tireness and pose a negative impact on their physical health. 
As for me , a healthy body is to study what water is to fish . It enables a student to exert every effort to concentrate. on study without being distracted by sickness. Moreover, a healthy body equips a student with enough energy to face the challenges of study and make steady progress. 
Apart from adding P. E.  tests, there are still many feasible ways to improve students' health. To start with, school are supposed to provide students with healthy diets such as vegetables. Secondly. students should control the desire of using computers frequently. Last but not least parents should take on the responsibility of talking to their kids and relieving them from stress. "
high_b (66).jpg,20,"Facing the proldem of obesity, poor eyesight and stress among Chiese students, someome suggested including P. E.  in the Gaokao. However, some believed that the heavier stress would wonsen their overall health. 
There's no denying the fact that Physical Education should be paid more attention to , for the alarming increase in obesity, poor sight and stress among Chinese students, which will cause health problems and even mental problems. By forcing students to be more active, losing weight will be more easy to do. 
For this reason, it's certainly vital to balance between study and health. Involing in study but ignoring health is not a good idea, and so is playing sports but ignoring study. On no account should we spend all the time doing one thing. Studying or doing exercise, our brain or body can be always active. 
From my own perspective, there's a weed to prevent students from eatting too much junk food and staying in front of computens too long. Students who under heavy pressure may need someone who can relif their anxity. Therefore, Mental Education should be set to turn the pessimistic students into optinistic ones. To improve students' health quality, there 's still a long way to go in china. "

To begin with, the main reason why the entity bookstore are on the decrease is that more and more E books replace the entity books with the development of science. What more, the other important reason is that the entity bookstores have a range of problems such as higher prices and fewer books. Therefore, we should take action to solve them. Not only can it make the entity bookstores better, but it can be more convenient for readers.

The novel coronavirus in Wuhan is being watched by many peple in the world, and the outbreak of it has been confirrned to be related to wild animals. So what should we do for human health and safety? 
Wild animals have been affected by human activities and natural disasters. Their numbers are dwindling. They carry the virus. so in order to solve the problem, China has passed laws to crack down on killing wild animals. Killing wild animals can spread diseases. The virus is infections and it's hard to cure. It will seriously affect people's life and health. So we shouldn't eat wild animals, we should strictly prohibit the hunting and killing wild animals and advice people to protect wild an imals. The better we do, the less likely the virus is to spread.

Today, with the development of economy, more and more anmmals are hunted illegally, and the number of wild animals is decreasing rapidly at the sametime. 
From my point of view, it is wrong to hunt wild animals because it's harmful to both humans and animals. First it can damage the ecosystem. Second, it causes infectious diseases, such as the novel coronavirus, which makes many people infected. What's more, it eventually prevent our economy from developing. I think we should make more laws to protect wild animals and the government should let more people aware of the importance of animal protection. As a student we shouldn't eat wil animals.
